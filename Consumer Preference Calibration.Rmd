Can be extended for n goods -> x and w are vectors of equal length. They can be extended to whatever length is required.h

# Cobb Douglas

```{r}
x = c(5, 8)
w = c(2, 5)

a = x*w / sum(x*w)

# CES

$$
\sigma = 1/(1-r)
$$

```{r}
sigma = 0.75
x = c(5, 8, 5)
w = c(2, 5, 10)

x_sigma = x^(1/sigma)

a = x_sigma*w / sum(x_sigma*w)
